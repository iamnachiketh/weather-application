# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

*Use npm run dev to the run the application*

There are mainly two components SearchBar component and WeatherCard component

1. SearchBar Component: To Search for a specific city or country
2. WeatherCard Component: To Display the details of a country or city.

I have used vite to config the application.
